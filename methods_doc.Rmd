```

## Preface

This document outlines the methods used to analyze Crime-Free Housing programs in Arizona. In most instances, these methods follow the approaches used in Griswold et al., 2023 and Griswold et al., 2024. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
